\chapter{Conclusions}
The project has reached a satisfactory level of completion.
As it could be seen in the testing chapter, most of the requirements have been met.

Nevertheless, the system is far from optimal and could still benefit from further development.
The following sections will elaborate on the flaws of the solution and attempt to provide viable ways of improving them.

As a whole, the project has been a valid and compelling opportunity for exploring the Google ecosystem as well as the Android and R development environments. 
Although the tools used have not been fully mastered, the principles acquired over the course of the project provides a solid foundation upon which future knowledge will rest.
