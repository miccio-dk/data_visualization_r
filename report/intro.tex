\chapter{Introduction}
This introductory chapter will provide a description of the project in the form of assignment formulation, and a brief overview of the implementation, which will be elaborated further in the following chapters.

\section{Problem formulation}
The aim of the project is the application of methods for integrating mobile phone (Android, iPhone) sensor measurements and an R data visualization environment using the Google Cloud as buffer.

\section{System description}
The implemented system is composed of three main elements: a series of end users' mobile devices, a remote host, and a \emph{data analyst} station.

The former are equipped with a custom-made application capable of transmitting geolocalization data to a remote destination.

The remote destination is represented by a \emph{Google Sheet} document where such data is stored.
This spreadsheet acts as a database for the collected data, and is accessible through the cloud.

The user--data analyst can then visualize the collected data in real-time, using the provided R scripts and a web browser.
