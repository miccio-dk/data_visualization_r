\chapter{Analysis}
The following sections aim to elaborate on the Problem formulation and create a more solid base to use as a guideline and template during the actual development.
This analysis does not aspire to be exhaustive, but rather satisfactory in the level of detail required to establish the project.

\section{Milestone plan}
Here is the project milestone plan as formulated during the initial phases of the project.
This version of the plan lists a series of achievements deemed necessary to accomplish the major functionalities.
It is arranged in a progressive way, with a time axis roughly flowing vertically.
Each task depends from its sub-tasks and --- more indirectly --- on the previous ones within its hierarchal level.

% Please refer to the \nameref{ch:appx} for the final version of the milestone plan based on the actual progress.
